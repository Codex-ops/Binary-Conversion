<br>How do we convert a Binary IP to a Decimal IP</br> 
</h1>

### Let's define what a binary IP is

"01111111.00000000.00000000.00000001"
- This a Binary  IP address
- 
- What is an octet an octet is 8 bits of a binary IP address 
-
- How long is a Binary IP address in bits a binary IP is 32 bits or 4 bytes 
 

now what is this binary ip showing us its just ones and zeros well think of it as a light and one is on and 0 is off

one way you can convert it is by using the power of 2 for example 


(128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1) powers of 2 

now just line up the first octet of the binary ip with the powers of 2 table 

 0   1  1  1 1 1 1 1
128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1

once they are lined up just add the numbers up with a one over it so 
64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 127 and boom you got the first number of the IP address
